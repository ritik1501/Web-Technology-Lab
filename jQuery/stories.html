            <h4>The lion and the Mouse</h4>
            A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun. This
            disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse
            desperately
            requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.”
            The
            lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go. One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took
            the lion with them. They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and started to
            whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the
            ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped off into the jungle.

            <h2>The Fox and the Stork</h2>
            One day, a selfish fox invited a stork for dinner. Stork was very happy with the invitation – she reached
            the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door with her long beak. The fox took her to the dinner table and
            served some soup in shallow bowls for both of them. As the bowl was too shallow for the stork, she couldn’t
            have soup at all. But, the fox licked up his soup quickly. The stork was angry and upset, but she didn’t
            show her anger and behaved politely. To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited him for dinner the next
            day. She too served soup, but this time the soup was served in two tall narrow vases. The stork devoured the
            soup from her vase, but the fox couldn’t drink any of it because of his narrow neck. The fox realised his
            mistake and went home famished.
